# GUESSNUMBERSGAME1
# 🎮 Guess The Number Game (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview

The *Guess The Number Game* is a Java-based console application where the computer randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The game is played in multiple rounds, and a scoring system rewards the player based on how quickly the correct number is guessed.

This project is beginner-friendly and helps in understanding basic Java programming concepts through a fun and interactive game.
